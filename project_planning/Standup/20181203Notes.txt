Step 1:  Who is suppose to be in my class?
Miranda has written a route `/attendence` Here is the code:
<code>
  app.get("/attendence", function(req, res) {
    db.Course.findAll({
      include: [
        {
          model: db.Students,
          as: "course_students",
          through: "student_course_map",
          foreignKey: "student_id"
        }
      ]
    }).then(function(dbCourse) {
      res.render("attendence", {
        course: dbCourse
        // scm: dbSCM,
        // students: dbStudents
      });
    });
  });
</code>

That route renders the view `attendence.handlebars`.
This is the list of all of the classes and the students in those classes with a checkbox (or toggle) so that the teacher can take attendence.
When the form is loaded for the first time, the toggles are all set to abasent -- or if checkboxes, all not checked.

When the form is submitted, via clicking the submit button, the attence records are created via a post route.

To get started, know what fields are necessary in the attendence table.  They are:
`id`,
`attendence_dt`,
`absent`,
`person_id`,
`created_at`,
`updated_at`,
`student_id`,
`course_id`
`id` `created at` and `updated at` are automatic -- so we don't need to create those.




  app.get("/api/course_students", function(req, res) {
    db.Course.findAll({
      include: [
        {
          model: db.Students,
          as: "course_students",
          through: "student_course_map",
          foreignKey: "student_id"
        }
      ]
    }).then(function(result) {
      res.json(result);
    });
  });
